**🧠 Models Included**

Linear Regression Model

Predicts continuous values from input features.

Built with PyTorch nn.Linear.

Multi-class Classification Model 1

Handles multi-class classification tasks.

Uses nn.Module and softmax output.

Multi-class Classification Model 2

Alternative architecture for multi-class tasks.

Includes example training loop and evaluation metrics.

⚡ **Installation**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/anwarbarix427/pytorch_model_classification.git
cd pytorch_model_classification


\\Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Or manually:

pip install torch scikit-learn matplotlib numpy

**▶ How to Run**

Run any model by specifying the file name:

python linear_regression_model.py


Replace with multi_class_model1.py or multi_class_model2.py to run the classification models.
